Speech Emotion Recognition Project

Abstract
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to develop a system capable of
automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. This involves collecting a dataset of
speech samples labeled with corresponding emotions, applying preprocessing techniques
to clean and standardize the audio data, and using feature extraction methods to capture
relevant information. Machine learning models are then trained on these features to classify
emotions. The model's performance is evaluated and fine-tuned before being deployed in a
real-world application for real-time emotion recognition.
